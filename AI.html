    <h3>What is AI?</h3>
    
    
    <div class="container-fluid infobox">
          <p>AI is a buzzword which is mentioned a lot in the media and popular culture,
            but many people do not understand the real world uses of this technology.
            While it is true that one day AI could include humanoid robots, in reality
            its applications are very broad, and very useful. Simply put, AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.
            It is the use of computers to solve problems which typically require human intelligence, and AI programs
            are made in an unconventional way; rather than being fixed pieces of code that execute a task,
            AI constantly adapts to make itself more suited to the task, similarly to how humans learn. </p>

          <p>A common implementation of AI is through something called a Neural Network. This is a collection of nodes, similar to synapses in a brain. There are input nodes, output nodes, and "hidden nodes". Each node is connected to the layer either side of it, where it manipulates its inputs and generates an output. While this may result in random outputs at first, over time these nodes can "evolve" and tweak themselves to give a more meaningful output.</p>

    <h3>Application: Detecting COVID</h3>
    <div class="container-fluid infobox" >
      <p>An AI application was developed that was able to detect asymptomatic covid with a 98.5% success rate.
        It did this by recording the sound of participants coughing.
        The sound of coughs from people with covid differs slightly to that of people without,
        but it is undiscernible to the human ear. Researchers fed the neural network algorithm with
        70000 cough and breath sounds and samples, of which 2500 were from people with a positive coronavirus test. With these samples, the neural network can "evolve" as mentioned above, in such a way so that it associates the positive coughs with "positive"(1) and negative coughs with "negative"(0). This means when it is then fed a previously unheard cough sample, it can run the sample through the same nodes and generate a number between 0 and 1, a probability of the cough being from someone with covid or not.</p>
