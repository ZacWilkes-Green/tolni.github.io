<h1>The incredible uses of AI</h1>
<p>AI is a buzzword which is mentioned a lot in the media and popular culture, but many people do not understand the real world uses of this technology. While it is true that one day AI could include humanoid robots, in reality its applications are very broad, and very useful. For example, let's take COVID as a case study:</p>
<div></div>
<p>An AI application was developed that was able to detect asymptomatic covid with a 98.5% success rate. It did this by recording the sound of participants coughing. The sound of coughs from people with covid differs slightly to that of people without, but it is undiscernible to the human ear. Researchers fed the neural network algorithm with 70000 cough and breath sounds and samples, of which 2500 were from people with a positive coronavirus test. A deep learning neural network algorithm works by decomposing a sound, running those sounds through nodes which perform simple arithmetic operations to the sound, and then a number between 0 and 1 is produced at the end giving the likelihood of covid. With known results, the algorithm can tweak its nodes such that all the known covid cases with sounds will produce a value of 1, and all the known negative cases with sounds will produce a value of 0. This means when unknown sound samples are given to the machine, it can accurately predict whether that person has covid or not.</p>
