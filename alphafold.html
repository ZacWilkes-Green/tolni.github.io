        <h1>Alphafold</h1>
        <h4>Predicting Protein Folding Using AI</h4>
        <br>

        <p>Proteins have a wide range of uses and applications, from breaking down industrial waste to helping cure diseases. 
            This is all possible due to the trillions upon trillions of ways a protein can fold, which is determined by the amino acid sequence that makes up the protein. 
            It has been estimated that there are around 10<sup>300</sup> ways a typical protein could fold, and finding a way to predict how a protein folds given its amino acid sequence is known as the 'protein folding problem'.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>  
            Deepmind's Alphafold uses AI and deep-learning architecture to computationally predict the 3d structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence in a matter of days. 
            Current experimental techniques like cryo-electron microscopy, on the other hand, can take years per protein and require expensive specialised equipment. 
            Alphafold also produces results on-par with these experimental techniques, having errors only as small as the width of an atom or two on average.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            Alphafold's accurate predictions allow for leaps and bounds in understanding the human body, 
            from figuring out the ways signals are transmitted across cell membranes to investigating how and why certain proteins malfunction, 
            allowing us to improve our understanding of some diseases and find treatments faster. Alphafold isn't limited to only being used on 
            pre-existing, known proteins, but can help with discovering the hundreds of millions of proteins currently without models.
